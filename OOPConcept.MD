# Four OOP principles:

## Encapsulation:

_ Refers to bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class.
_ Itâ€™s the idea of hiding data within a class, preventing anything outside that class directly interacting with it.
_ Keeps the programmer in control of access to data.
_ Prevents the programmer from ending up in any strange or unwanted states.

## Abstraction:

_ Refers to the idea to only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden.
_ The classes you create should act like your car. Users of your classes should not worry
about the inner details of those classes. \* This is very important when working on your program incrementally.

## Inheritance: \* Is the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes.

## Polymorphism:

_ Describes methods that are able to take on many forms.
_ Allows methods to take on many different forms.
_ Be sure that you are calling the correct form of the method.
_ There are two types of polymorphism:

## Dynamic polymorphism:

- Occurs during the runtime of the program.
- Describes when a method signature is in both subclass and a superclass.
- The methods share the same name but have different implementation.
- The implementation of the subclass that the object is an instance of overrides that of the superclass.

## Static polymorphism:

- Occurs during compile-time rather than during runtime. - Refers to when multiply methods with the same name but different arguments are defined in the same class.
- The parameters are different type or taken in different order. - This is known as method overloading.
